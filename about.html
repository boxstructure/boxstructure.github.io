 				<p>Quercus Construct? It's design journal space of my progress exhibiting my progress and development in becoming a more refined designer.</p>

				<p>Purpose of Quercus Construct

				-Other than a place to showcase my projects, but a place for me to
				communicate my ideas and thoughts in regards to design, user centric research, and my personal inspiration (that pretty much means ANYTHING).</p>

				<p>Also it is my digital playground in continuing my education in visual communication and digital development. Last semester I’ve been introduced to the world of digital UX/UI design and had a lot of fun. 
				I am using Quercus Design not only to experiment with different web layouts but to retain and progress the little coding that I’ve learned (html/js/css).</p>

		 		<p>I suppose I should introduce myself. My name is Mike Sun and I am currently in my first year of master’s degree at the Institute of Design in Chicago.</p>

				<p>Growing up in a vibrant area of Bay Area, California, I felt that I was blessed to be surrounded by colorful diversity and priceless resources. Being keen and attentive to my surroundings, my perspective of the world only amplified when I attended University of California, Berkeley. It wasn’t just the education that I’ve received but the network of people from faculty members to fellow students that enriched my insights to humanistic values.</p>

				<p>I am focused on what kind of design?</p>

		 		<p>Before I get into my architectural education, my design foundation stemmed from my art education from my talented mother. My mother as a talented multidisciplinary artist encouraged me to open my mind and encouraged my use of imagination. </p>

				<p>It all started when I started to color the sky green instead of blue in one of my drawings which provoked my mother to ask,
				“why is the sky green and not blue?”<br>I answered, “I don’t know.”<br>
				Rather than correcting my choice in color, she instead helped my thought process in why I might have picked green over blue.
				It turned out that I wasn’t drawing a scene of this world but an imaginary world in a different galaxy. </p>

				<p>With such approach of not always having to conform to norms and exploring unconventional SOMETHING backed with rationale
				I’ve progressed and expanded my imagination  
				I’ve progressed on with my art interests to various form of design. Taking classes in graphic, motion, product, and architecture asdfasdfa;sldkfjals;dkfjasl;df</p>

		 		<p>He continued his design endeavors in architecture working mostly in large commercial architecture firms such as Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Gensler. Through his architectural experience, it allowed him to gain perspective of design process from social, context & environmental research to building design development.</p>

				<p>His architecture experience has become an invaluable asset to his design insights. In addition to the in depth research training that he has developed from his undergraduate studies, competitions, and services, he feels that he is more than capable of expanding his reach in developing variety of design solutions.</p>
