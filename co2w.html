						<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
						<p>Air pollution is one of the most pressing issues that the world is facing today. 
						The vast amount of pollutants releasing into our atmosphere  is damaging the air quality as well as the ozone layer. Many sources of the pollutants are man-made such as power  plants, vehicle discharge, chemicals, waste, etc.<br><br>

						The detrimental impact of our environment has led to an aggressive progression in
						alternative energy and clean technology. Our proposal is to develop a building component system for high-rise buildings that cleans the environment and generates energy.</p>

						<h3>DATA ABSTRATION</h3>
						<p>Interview data is abstrated to analyze the relationship between adult children and aging parent.

						<h3>DATA STORY PLATFORM</h3>
						<p>Infographic is then composed listing the insights from perspective of adult children, aging parent, and healthcare system. Composition is configured into 3 different quadrants representing each party’s insights: adult childrent on the left, aging parent on the right, healthcare system on the top.</p> 

						<p>The visual composition is carefully represented in multiple layers. At first, the hands signify the two primary parties of adult children and aging parent. In addressing St. Joseph’s intention of better serving this care, the overall graphic depicts two individuals embracing each other, signifying that this particular care needs to collaborative effort where the adult children, aging parents, and healthcare system need to be equal partners to provide better care.</p>
