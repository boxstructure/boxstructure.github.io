						<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
							<p>Metropolitan Tenants Organization (MTO) operates in Chicago in advocating rental tenants’ rights. They offer variety of services such as legal, health &amp; safety, and affordable rental opportunities. MTO services are available to everyone in the city; however, they were concerned about the low-income tenants. With limited resources, MTO faced challenges in figuring out a way to reach out and empower low-income tenants in need. 
							<br>As a part of 2-day BarnRaise conference of Institute of Design’s, we began with a question:<br><br>
							</p><h3>“How might we build an effective Communication Strategy for MTO in its efforts to reach out to low income renters?”</h3>
							<p></p>

						<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
						<p>The challenege began with in depth interview with a MTO representative on organizations current operations, offerings, issues, and efforts in reaching out to low income renters. Presented with a persona, we were able to lay out several key notes into systems diagram, framework analysis, and user journeys in understanding the problem.</p>

						<h3>FINDINGS</h3>
						<p>By mapping out the current  user journey of low-income renting process/living, we were able to pin point several pain points in which led to a possible prescriptive user flow in addressing each needs.</p>
