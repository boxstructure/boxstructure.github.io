						<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
						<p>Response time is a critical factor for all rescue workers. Lifeguards in particular have access to jet skis, motorboats, trucks, and ATVs to get to respond to critical situations. These vehicles however, are confined to the surface that they are designed for. </p>

						<p>Shoreline Rescue Vehicle is a vehicle design proposal in which boundary between land and water is no longer an obstacle. Shoreline Rescue Vehicle will enhance the response time from the beach by allowing lifeguards a quick vehicular access to the water.</p>

						<h3>DATA ORGANIZATION</h3>
						<p>Interview transcripts are broken down into individual statements categorized by statement, participant, category, and reasoning. All the information is then translated onto datamap indicating frequency and the severity of various issues in relation to each other.</p>

						<h3>DATA ABSTRATION</h3>
						<p>Interview data is abstrated to analyze the relationship between adult children and aging parent. Focusing on care activities and interaction characteristics, a layer of health system involvement/influence is represented in the middle. This revised data model reveals the emotional stress and concern broken down to individual activites indicated by quotes and observations.</p>

						<h3>DATA STORY PLATFORM</h3>
						<p>Infographic is then composed listing the insights from perspective of adult children, aging parent, and healthcare system. Composition is configured into 3 different quadrants representing each party’s insights: adult childrent on the left, aging parent on the right, healthcare system on the top.</p> 

						<p>The visual composition is carefully represented in multiple layers. At first, the hands signify the two primary parties of adult children and aging parent. In addressing St. Joseph’s intention of better serving this care, the overall graphic depicts two individuals embracing each other, signifying that this particular care needs to collaborative effort where the adult children, aging parents, and healthcare system need to be equal partners to provide better care.</p>
