						<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
						<p>Flare mobile application was developed on the need for mobile users to communicate more efficiently with their peers in regards to trivial interactions. Based on the growing trend of simplified text/photo messaging (ie. Twitter, instagram, Snapchat, Yo), there is a need for simplified communication based on ephemeral tasks rather than just expression. Ephemeral interaction needs an ephemeral tool.<br><br>

						This project focused on lean startup methodology is studied more indepth through quick prototyping touching on Branding, Experience, Business Model, and Organization. This yielded a deeper understanding project direction and refinement.</p>

						<h3>INITIAL THOUGHT</h3>
						<p id="flarConcept">“do you want me to get you something?”</p>
						<p>It happens all time time, at school, work, home, etc. It’s an ephemeral interaction that is often exchanged and forgotten. People often find themselves in situations desiring to do favors for others; however, faced with inconvenient steps in which such desires quickly evaporates.</p>

						<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
						<p>Flare mobile solution is to make this ephemeral interaction as simple as possible.<br>
						<ul id="flarList"><li>simple and direct communication</li>
						<li>automatic detail input (location, contacts, order)</li>
						<li>swift transaction</li></ul></p>

						<h3>PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
						<p>Through series of sketches and wireframe layouts, html mockup was made to understand the general user flow of app navigation. The initial prototype was developed within a week for a fast turnaround and testing.</p>

						<h3>WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
						<p>With user observation and initial testing, a better understanding of how a potential user may use such application was understood.<br><br>

						The process of refining the project through Branding, Experience, Business Model, Organization cycle, led to further analysis of the concept to better understand market’s interest, user experience, and sustainable offerings. <br><br>
